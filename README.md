## Modular JavaScript Portfolio

Live link can be found here -> (Portfolio)[https://soumik43.github.io/Modular-javascript-portfolio/]

Modularising your JavaScript code can be done by splitting code over multiple files and using JavaScript modules to share functionalities across different files.

Here separating the code from content of your personal portfolio website. The data for website will be stored in form of .json files.
These will include data for different components like Headers, Footers, Banner etc.

- Model different components and store data needed for that component into a .json file
- The website will be broken down into resuable components.
    E.g Header can be broken down into Logo and Navigation_Links
- Each component has to be created as a JavaScript class or function constructor.
- The main app file will import these different components and render to create your entire webpage.
